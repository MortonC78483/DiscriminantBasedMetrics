Trying to choose which variables to pick from ipums data for analysis. Goals for the variables are something that has a clear minority/majority split in the data and that . 
Then, want to do synthetic data analysis to show that either:

[Bad synthesis]
1) when we compare data synthesized from only the majority group, then permuted, to the original data, we see that the discriminant based metrics do a bad job of discriminating.
2) when we isolate to the minority group, the metrics do a better job, and they still do a bad job when we isolate to the majority group.

[Permutation]
1) when we compare permuted VOI data to original data (no synthesis involved), we can't discriminate well between datasets for the large data, but we can discriminate well for isolated minority groups.
2) when we use different model types and discriminant based metrics, we're not able to discriminate much better between synthetic and confidential datasets when we permute our VOI post-synthesis compared to when we don't permute.
3) when we isolate to the minority group and compare, we can discriminate well.

library(tidyverse)
library(ipumsr)
library(srvyr)
library(tidysynthesis)
library(parsnip)
library("data.table")
library(recipes)
library(devtools)
load_all('../syntheval')
library(syntheval)
library(dials)

library(gtools)
```

```{r}
data <- read_ipums_micro("data/usa_00004.xml")
data <- data |>
  mutate(across(where(is.labelled), ~as_factor(lbl_clean(.x))))
```

```{r}
states <- c("Michigan")
vars <- c("STATEFIP", "PERNUM", "SEX", "AGE", "RACE", 
           "HCOVANY", "EDUC", "EMPSTAT", "FTOTINC", "POVERTY",
           "VETSTAT")

```

```{r}
data_mi <- data %>%
  select(all_of(vars)) %>%
  filter(STATEFIP %in% states,
         PERNUM == 1) 
# recode factor variables (vetstat, sex, race, healthcare coverage, employment status didn't need recoding)
data_mi$EDUC <- recode(data_mi$EDUC, 
               "N/A or no schooling" = "N/A",
               "Nursery school to grade 4" = "Less than high school",
               "Grade 5, 6, 7, or 8" = "Less than high school",
               "Grade 9" = "Some high school",
               "Grade 10" = "Some high school",
               "Grade 11" = "Some high school",
               "Grade 12" = "High school",
               "1 year of college" = "Some college",
               "2 years of college" = "Some college",
               "4 years of college" = "4+ years of college",
               "5+ years of college" = "4+ years of college")

# recode numeric variables (age, poverty (as % of poverty threshold), and income)
data_mi$AGE <- as.numeric(as.character(recode(data_mi$AGE, 
                      "Less than 1 year old"= "0",
                      "90 (90+ in 1980 and 1990)" = "90")))
data_mi$FTOTINC <- as.numeric(as.character(recode(data_mi$FTOTINC,
                                     "No income (1950-2000, ACS/PRCS) " = "0")))
data_mi$POVERTY <- as.numeric(as.character(recode(data_mi$POVERTY,
                                     "501 percent or more of poverty threshold" = "500",
                                     "1 percent or less of poverty threshold (including 0 or negative income)" = "0")))

# set character NAs to be NA
data_mi[data_mi == "N/A"]<-NA 

# complete case analysis of adults only
data_mi <- data_mi %>%
  filter(AGE >= 19,
         complete.cases(.)) %>%
  select(-c("STATEFIP", "PERNUM"))

# get rid of unused NA levels in factors (educ, empstat, vetstat)
data_mi = droplevels(data_mi)
```

Looking at veteran status
```{r}
data_mi <- data_mi %>%
  filter(RACE %in% c("White", "Black/African American"))
data_mi$black <- ifelse(data_mi$RACE == "Black/African American", 1, 0)
table(data_mi$VETSTAT, data_mi$RACE)
prop.table(table(data_mi$black, data_mi$HCOVANY), 1)
prop.table(table(data_mi$black, data_mi$EMPSTAT), 1)
prop.table(table(data_mi$black, data_mi$EDUC), 1)
prop.table(table(data_mi$black, data_mi$SEX), 1)

ggplot(data_mi, aes(group = black, x = log(FTOTINC+1), color = black))+
  geom_density()

ggplot(data_mi, aes(group = black, x = POVERTY, color = black))+
  geom_density()

data_mi <- data_mi %>%
  select(-c(RACE))
```

So now we're at a majority and minority (white and Black, with Black = 7% of dataset), where many of the variables are indeed menaingfully correlated with the race of people
```{r}
sum(data_mi$black)/nrow(data_mi)

library(caret)

#define one-hot encoding function
dummy <- dummyVars(" ~ .", data=data_mi)

#perform one-hot encoding on data frame
final_df <- data.frame(predict(dummy, newdata=data_mi)) %>%
  select(-c("SEX.Male", "HCOVANY.With.health.insurance.coverage", "EDUC.4..years.of.college", "EMPSTAT.Not.in.labor.force", "VETSTAT.Veteran"))

cor <- round(cor(final_df), 2)

install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cor, type = "upper", order = "hclust", 
         tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)

# Get some colors
col<- colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(20)
heatmap(x = cor, col = col, symm = TRUE)
```

1) when we compare data synthesized from only the majority group, then permuted, to the original data, we see that the discriminant based metrics do a bad job of discriminating.
```{r}
# original synthesis
start_data = data_mi[,"black"]
#start_data$black = rep(0, nrow(data_mi))
conf_data = data_mi #%>%
  #filter(black == 0)

# synthesize categorical first, then continuous
visit_sequence = visit_sequence(c("SEX", "VETSTAT", "EMPSTAT", "EDUC", "HCOVANY", "POVERTY", "FTOTINC", "AGE"), start_data, type = "manual")
roadmap = roadmap(conf_data, start_data, visit_sequence)
recipe = construct_recipes(roadmap = roadmap)

tree_cl <- parsnip::decision_tree(cost_complexity = .0001) %>%
  set_mode(mode = "classification") %>%
  set_engine(engine = "rpart")
tree_reg <- parsnip::decision_tree(cost_complexity = .0001) %>%
  set_mode(mode = "regression") %>%
  set_engine(engine = "rpart")

synth_spec = synth_spec(roadmap,
                        synth_algorithms = list(tree_cl, tree_cl, tree_cl, tree_cl, tree_cl, tree_reg, tree_reg, tree_reg),
                        recipe,
                        predict_methods = sample_rpart)

# noise
noise <- noise(roadmap = roadmap,
               add_noise = FALSE,
               exclusions = 0)

# constraints
constraints <- constraints(roadmap = roadmap,
                           constraints = NULL,
                           max_z = 0)

replicates <- replicates(replicates = 1,
                         workers = 1,
                         summary_function = NULL)

# create a presynth object
presynth1 <- presynth(
  roadmap = roadmap,
  synth_spec = synth_spec,
  noise = noise, 
  constraints = constraints,
  replicates = replicates
)
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
synthesized = synthesize(presynth1, progress = TRUE)
```

2) when we isolate to the minority group, the metrics do a better job, and they still do a bad job when we isolate to the majority group.
```{r}
disc_tree <- function(discriminator){
  # Evaluate discriminant-based metrics on the data using tree-based model
  tree_mod <- decision_tree(cost_complexity = tune()) %>%
    set_mode(mode = "classification") %>%
    set_engine(engine = "rpart")
  
  rpart_rec <- recipe(.source_label ~ ., data = discriminator$combined_data)
  
  grid = grid_regular(cost_complexity(), levels= 10)
  
  # set up discriminator
  d <- discriminator %>%
    add_propensities_tuned(
      grid = grid, 
      recipe = rpart_rec,
      spec = tree_mod
    ) %>%
    add_discriminator_auc() %>%
    add_specks() %>%
    add_pmse()
  res = c(d$discriminator_auc, d$pmse, d$specks)
  return(c(res$.estimate[2], res$.pmse[2], res$.specks[2]))
}


disc_rf <- function(discriminator){
  # Evaluate discriminant-based metrics on the data using random forest
  rand_forest_mod <- rand_forest(
    mode = "classification",
    engine = "randomForest",
    mtry = NULL,
    trees = NULL,
    min_n = NULL
  )
  
  rpart_rec <- recipe(.source_label ~ ., data = discriminator$combined_data)
  
  # set up discriminator
  d_rf <- discriminator %>%
    add_propensities(
      recipe = rpart_rec,
      spec = rand_forest_mod
    ) %>%
    add_discriminator_auc() %>%
    add_specks() %>%
    add_pmse()
  res = c(d_rf$discriminator_auc, d_rf$pmse, d_rf$specks)
  return(c(res$.estimate[2], res$.pmse[2], res$.specks[2]))
}
```

```{r}
# apply permutation to dataset
synthesized_data <- synthesized$synthetic_data
#synthesized_data$black <- permute(data_mi$black)
synthesized_data_black <- synthesized_data %>%
  filter(black == 1)
data_mi_black <- data_mi %>%
  filter(black == 1)
synthesized_data_white <- synthesized_data %>%
  filter(black == 0)
data_mi_white <- data_mi %>%
  filter(black == 0)

# whole dataset
d_synthesized = discrimination(synthesized_data, data_mi)
d_tree = disc_tree(d_synthesized)
d_rf= disc_rf(d_synthesized)
whole <- cbind(d_tree, d_rf)
whole

# isolate to minority group
d_synthesized_black = discrimination(synthesized_data_black, data_mi_black)
d_tree = disc_tree(d_synthesized_black)
d_rf= disc_rf(d_synthesized_black)
black <- cbind(d_tree, d_rf)
black

# isolate to majority group
d_synthesized_white = discrimination(synthesized_data_white, data_mi_white)
white <- cbind(disc_tree(d_synthesized_white),
           disc_rf(d_synthesized_white))
white
```

```{r}

```
